## tensorflow_nn
Some simple neural networks are implemented through tensorflow<br>
#include<br>
* basic operation of tensorflow<br>
* use tensorflow to realize deep learning models<br>
* more detailed annotations in the code<br>
<br>
#note<br>
all the demo based on mnist dataï¼Œabout Handwritten digit recognition <br>


<br>
For the first time to learn tensorflow, there are deficiencies. Please make corrections.<br>
