# tensorflow_nn
Some simple neural networks are implemented through tensorflow
include<br>
* basic operation of tensorflow<br>
* use tensorflow to realize deep learning models<br>
* more detailed annotations in the code<br>
<br>
note<br>
* all the demo based on mnist data，about Handwritten digit recognition <br>
* teacher MoVan's vedio give me a lot of inspiration，if you intersted in ,you can try
<br>
For the first time to learn tensorflow, there are deficiencies. Please make corrections.<br>
